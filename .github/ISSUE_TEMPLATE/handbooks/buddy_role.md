# Brainhack buddy: role description

The [OHBM Brainhack 2020](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/) will gather researchers throughout the world for an online hackathon June 16-18, organized around 3 hubs: 'Asia and Pacific', 'Africa, Middle East and Europe' and the 'Americas'.

**Brainhack buddies** play an essential role in onboarding attendees who join a hackathon for the first time. 

**Short description**
*You have already attended a brainhack, are keen in welcoming new members in the Brainhack community? Sign up as a Brainhack buddy! You will be paired with an attendee who is coming to their first hackathon. You will spend 1-hour a day with them to help their onboarding.*

**Description**
Each new comer (never attended a Brainhack before) will have the opportunity to  be paired with a buddy (that has already attended at least one Brainhack). They will receive information ahead of the hackathon and meet during the event.

A buddy is a member of the open science neuroimaging community who:
 - has already attended at least one brain hackathon (e.g. Brainhack, Brainhack school, Neurohackademy, etc.)
 - is familiar with the format of the OHBM Brainhack and in particular with the two tracks (Hacktrack and Traintrack)
 - feels comfortable welcoming new members of the community, listening to there experience and share information as needed
 

**Expectations**
1. Help develop and maintain a welcoming environment at the OHBM Brainhack
2. If possible, have a pre-Brainhack meeting with your paired attendee.
6. During the Brainhack, meet twice with the attendee who have been paired with to 1- hear about their experience, 2- get feedback on the event, 3- provide any input they would like. Communicate feedback or any identified issues with hub leads as needed.

**Estimated time**: maximum 1 hour before Brainhack and 30 minutes to 1 hour per day during Brainhack.

**Join the team!** Thank you so much for willing to help. In order to sign up as a Brainhack buddy, please fill in this form (TODO!).
