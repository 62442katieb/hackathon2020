# Social team: role description

The [OHBM Brainhack 2020](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/) will gather researchers throughout the world for an online hackathon June 16-18, organized around 3 hubs: 'Asia and Pacific', 'Africa, Middle East and Europe' and the 'Americas'.

The **social team** play an essential role in designing the social breaks that will happen during the hackathon.
