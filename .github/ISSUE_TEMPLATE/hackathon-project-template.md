### Link to your repository

If your project involves any code you will want to set up a GitHub or GitLab repository for it
(if you don't have one already).

If your project does not involve any coding, simply add a link to the relevant documents
(google docs or on the open science framework) you will be working on.

[YourRepo](_insert_URL_here) with a [README.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) containing:
-   project idea and context;
-   installation guidelines if applicable;  
-   links to further reading/tutorials;   
-   and if you want, additional files such as [Contributors.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/), to specify which types of people can contribute how.

### Specific goal
Try to describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack.

If your project is just starting it might simply be "discuss, set up a roadmap, and identify potential obstacles".

For some other projects it could be a set of **SMART** goals:
-   Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
-   Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
-   Achievable (agreed, attainable).
-   Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
-   Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

If you have set up a repository for your code, we will ask you to open at least 2 `good first issues`
issues that describe the goals you would like to achieve in this brainhack.

Some examples:
-   implement a new feature for a package
-   create a tutorial for a package
-   make a Python version of your Matlab based toolbox
-   come up with a prototype of a standardized consent form that can be used by different labs
-   create a fantastic list of neuroscience resources that will help generations of young researchers to come

## Skills we are particularly looking for

What different types of people could contribute?

It is not all about coding. Are you interested in collaborating with someone with a good flair for
good visualization? Someone with more experience who can make a good user interface? Someone who
knows how to develop good, tidy and clear documentation ?

### Participant capacity

As a project leader it is important that you do not overstretch yourself.
Try to estimate the maximum number of people you would be comfortable having on your team.

### Integration

How would your project integrate a physicist/imager/clinician/psychologist/computational
scientist/maker/artist/lawyer as a collaborator?

You can check the Mozilla Open Leadership material on
[personas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and [contribution guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).

## Communication

### Chat

Add a link to the communication channel for your project.

You can, for example, create a mattermost channel for your project inside the
[brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), and include a mattermost badge
<a href="https://mattermost.brainhack.org/">
  <img src="http://www.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logoHorizontal.png" width=100px>
</a> to invite people to the brainhack mattermost, where they can then find and join your channel.

If you already have a [slack]() workspace or are using [gitter]() or [discord]() or any other platform
to communicate for your project, just mention it here.

### Video calls

To facilitate coordination we suggest you set up a [jitsi room](https://meet.jit.si/) or use
zoom / [a permanent skype group](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34799/how-do-i-create-a-group-chat-in-skype-on-desktop) /
google hangouts or some similar service so you can interact live with all project members wherever they are.

### Suggested meeting time
We recommend you have at least daily video meetings with your team members to organize things and
keep track of progress.

Try to suggest a time when meetings will happen. Of course this can then be changed and adapted if it
turns out that most of the people who come to help you live in a completely different time zone from yours.

### Code template to add

If you want to help us list your project on the hackathon website, you can paste your `PROJECT TITLE`
and `PROJECT DESCRIPTION` and the `ISSUE_NUMBER`of your project in the snippet of code below. You can
also provide an image for your project.

If you want you can then open a pull-request to add this code in the
[`_data/project.yml`](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/_data/project.yml)
file. If you have no idea how to do this, don't worry: we are here
to help.

If you want to add an image to illustrate your project it should go in the
[`img/hackathon`](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/tree/master/img/hackathon) folder.
If you don't have any image you can use `whatever.png`


```
 -
   title: "PROJECT TITLE"
   image: IMAGE_FILENAME
   details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
   <br>More information <a href=https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER>in this github issue</a>"
```
