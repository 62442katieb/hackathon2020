We have prepared a checklist to help you submit your project. You don't have to have checked all of those to open the issue. Our team will help you finalize all the steps.

If you are confused about anything you can reach us on the `help - general` channel on the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/).

**Project submission checklist**

# Name of your awesome project

## Project Description

Main idea and context.

### Project leaders

Because projects will be coordinated across several time zones, it is important to identify the project leaders and their time zones.

**List of time zones with cities**

### Link to your repository

If your project involves any code you will want to set up a GitHub or GitLab repository for it (if you don't have one already).

If your project does not involve any coding, simply add a link to the relevant documents (google docs or on the open science framework) you will be working on.

[YourRepo](_insert_URL_here) with a [REAME.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) containing:
-   project idea and context;
-   installation guidelines if applicable;  
-   links to further reading/tutorials;   
-   and if you want, additional files such as [Contributors.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/), to specify which types of people can contribute how.

### Specific goal
Try to describe what you want to achieve during this hackathon.

If your project is just starting it might simply be "discuss, set up a roadmap, and identify potential obstacles".

For some other projects it could be a set of **SMART** goals:
-   Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
-   Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
-   Achievable (agreed, attainable).
-   Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
-   Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

If you have set up a repository for your code, we will ask you to open at least 2 `good first issues` issues that describe the goals you would like to achieve in this hackathon.

Some examples:
-   implement a new feature for a package
-   create a tutorial for a package
-   make a python version of your matlab based toolbox
-   come up with a prototype of a standardized consent form that can be used by different labs
-   create a fantastic list of neuroscience ressources that will help generations of young researchers to come

## Skills required to participate

What different types of people could contribute?

### Participant capacity

As a project leader it is important that you do not overstretch yourself. Try to estimate the maximum number of people you would be comfortable having on your team.

### Integration

How would your project integrate a physicist/imager/clinician/psychologist/computational scientist/maker/artist/lawyer as a collaborator?

You can check the Mozilla Open Leadership material on [personas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and [contribution guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).

## Communication

### Chat

Add a link to the communication channel for your project.

You can, for example, create a mattermost channel for your project inside the [brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), and include a Mattermost badge <a href="https://mattermost.brainhack.org/"><img src="http://www.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logoHorizontal.png" width=100px /> to invite people to the brainhack mattermost, where they can then find and join your channel.

If you already have a [slack]() workspace or are using [gitter]() or [discord]() or any other platform to communicate for your project, just mention it here.

### Video calls

To facilitate coordination we suggest you set up a [jitsi room](https://meet.jit.si/) or use zoom / [a permanent skype group](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34799/how-do-i-create-a-group-chat-in-skype-on-desktop) / google hangout or some similar service so you can interact live with all project members wherever they are.

### Suggested meeting time
We recommend you have at least daily video meetings with your team members to organize things and keep track of progress.

Try to suggest a time when meetings will happen. Of course this can then be changed and adapted if it turns out that most of the people who come to help you live on a completely different time zone from yours.
