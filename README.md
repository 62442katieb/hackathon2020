## What is a hackathon?

The word `hackathon` can be split into "hacking" and "marathon‚Äù.

A *hackathon* can then be defined as an event in which you can intensively (that's the **marathon** part) and collaboratively work (that's the **hacking** part) on a common project. Hackathons are different than the typical academic conference sessions because individuals will be actively trying to accomplish something rather than merely attending. As a rule of thumb, think of hackathon attendees as saying "I am here to help" and of a hackathon leader being able to tell them "here's what you can do to help."

**Although many hackathon projects might involve coding, it is not necessarily the case and many projects can be done using only google docs for example.**

After the hackathon, you can keep collaborating to finish the project and even decide to publish it depending on the predefined goals.

## What kind of projects can you find in a hackathon?

The projects can be things the project leader is already working on, or a project they would like to receive contribution/opinion/help, or a completely new project they would like to accomplish with group work.

You can find example of projects listed in the different [brainhack events](http://www.brainhack.org/) or directly on the websites of previous hackathons :

## Applications are now open for Hackathon Travel Awards

The Hackathon Travel Awards will include free registration at the hackathon plus $500 that will go towards covering part of the expenses incurred to attend the event. To submit an application, please fill out our survey at:

## Registration for the hackathon will open early March.

In the past two years the hackathon was fully booked and we therefore recommend interested attendees to register early. Seats will be allocated on a first come first serve basis. In an effort to increase diversity at the event, we will reserve part of the seats to attendees who attend a hackathon for the first time or who come from traditionally under-represented groups in science or in past hackathons.
