# OHBM 2020 Hackathon

This repository hosts the hackathon projects and communication related to the OHBM 2020 hackathon.

In order to take part in the HackTrack, you will first have to register for the event. After that, you can suggest a project to lead at the OHBM 2020 hackathon, or join a project that has already been suggested.

At the beginning of our event, all project leaders will briefly describe their project to recruit team members.
If you are interested in a certain project, you can approach these project leaders afterwards and express your interest in participating.
At the end of the openMR event, there will be wrap up of each project with a short presentation to inform attendees about the project progress and future tasks to be done.

## What is a hackathon?

The word `hackathon` can be split into "hacking" and "marathon”.

A <i>hackathon</i> can then be defined as an event in which you can intensively (that's the **marathon** part) and collaboratively work (that's the **hacking** part) on a common project. Hackathons are different than the typical academic conference sessions because individuals will be actively trying to accomplish something rather than merely attending. As a rule of thumb, think of hackathon attendees as saying "I am here to help" and of a hackathon leader being able to tell them "here's what you can do to help."

**Although many hackathon projects might involve coding, it is not necessarily the case and many projects can be done using only google docs for example.**

After the hackathon, you can keep collaborating to finish the project and even decide to publish it depending on the predefined goals.

## What kind of projects can you find in a hackathon?

The projects can be things the project leader is already working on, or a project they would like to receive contribution/opinion/help, or a completely new project they would like to accomplish with group work.

You can find example of projects listed in the different [brainhack events](http://www.brainhack.org/) or directly on the websites of previous hackathons :

- [openMR 2020 hackathon](https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues)
- [OHBM 2019 hackathon](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/issues)
- [Brainhack Princeton 2019](https://github.com/brainhack-princeton/brainhack-princeton-2019)
- [Brainhack Open Geneva 2020]("https://brainhack.ch/#portfolio)
- [BrainHack Ghent 2018](https://brainhackghent.github.io)


If this is not enough, here are some projects that you could propose:
- improving existing materials to comparing certain methods or creating packages
- creating youtube videos to present your favorite tool or some of its feature
- help improve the online documentation of some software (like the [SPM wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM))



## Suggesting or joining a project

When you propose a project make sure that it has a rough plan about the amount of work that needs to be done and that it has clear goals that can be (partly) achieved during the (short) amount of time you are provided with.

Since you won’t have any knowledge about the expertise profile of the other Brainhack attendees until the hackathon starts, it is better to incorporate some flexibility into your project plan and schedule. Because there is always a possibility of getting help from any number of attendees on many different aspects of your project that you didn’t plan ahead. Please do not undermine the contribution that would come from any of the attendees at the event. This is one of the important parts of the event. Be inclusive and open to the contributions. Especially if they come from an early career researcher and he/she is there to learn from you; please do not forget that you were one of them once too and that providing people with an environment to learn and improve themselves is one of the main goals and gains of the event. And again you would never be able to know which contribution an attendee could provide you with. Therefore, it is always better to keep yourself open to different ideas and contributions and to let the brainstorming help you achieve your project’s goals.

We explain below how to to propose your own project idea, but you're not sure whether or how to work it out to a full project, please get in touch using our Contact Page and we're happy to help you out!
