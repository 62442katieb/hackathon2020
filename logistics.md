In addition to this event being the first ever virtual OHBM hackathon, it will also be happening three times within a 24 hour window, across multiple time-zones. The goal here is to ensure that more people from around the world are able to join in during reasonable working hours for them. 
* Americas Hub
* Europe, Middle East, and Africa Hub
* Asia and Pacific Oceania Hub

#### HackTrack 


#### TrainTrack 
The TrainTrack will cover topics ranging from good code practices, code and data version control, high performance computing, 
data visualization, and machine learning. Each session will have its own computing requirements, but at a baseline, 
we strongly recommend that participants make sure that they have the following general computing requirements satisfied. 
We will have a virtual help desk available to help participants with installation issues. 

{% accordion TrainTrack %}
{% collapse General computing requirements %}
In addition to some software that we will list in the subsequent section, these are the general computing requirements: 
1. Administrative access to your computer such that you can install software on your own. 
2. If you're using Windows, the required version is Windows 10. 
{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse Required software %}
Along with the platforms that we will be using for virtual TrainTrack presentations and communication, we ask that you 
install the following software. 

* A command-line shell: Bash
* A version control system: Git
* A remote-capable text editor: VSCode
* Python 3 via Miniconda
* A virtualization system: Docker
* A GitHub account
* Mattermost (can be used in the browser as well)
