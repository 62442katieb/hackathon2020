  description: "A beautiful visualization is not just a good-looking piece of graph, chart, or colored brain. It is an informative and efficient way to represent our data and results, which follows the scientific principles (e.g. honesty truth, consistency etc.). A compelling visualization is essential to organize the data, display the results, communicate the information, as well as change the way we perceive the world. The Brain Art special interest group  will walk you through the basics, share the skills of brain visualization, and make the brain visualization novel, creative, aesthetic and fun to the community."
