    A beautiful visualization is not just a good-looking piece of graph, chart, or colored brain.
    It is an informative and efficient way to represent our data and results, which follows the scientific
    principles (e.g. honesty truth, consistency etc.). A compelling visualization is essential to organize
    the data, display the results, communicate the information, as well as change the way we perceive the world.
    The Brain Art special interest group  will walk you through the basics, share the skills of brain visualization,
    and make the brain visualization novel, creative, aesthetic and fun to the community.

    Datalad is a versatile data management and data publication multitool. In this
    session, you can learn the basic concepts and commands for version control and reproducible data
    analysis. You’ll get to see, create, and install DataLad datasets of many shapes and sizes, master
    local version workflows and provenance-captured analysis-execution, and you will get ideas for your
    next data analysis project. Don’t forget to bring your computer and code along!

   downloading a dataset, (2) finding and running a pipeline, (3) uploading a dataset, and (4) uploading a tool.
   The demo will be recorded and could also serve as a tutorial. Only a web browser will be required to follow this tutorial,
  although advanced features would require Docker and DataLad."

                INCF supports open science working groups and groups that provide training on open science practices.
                Since 2013, INCF has supported OHBM’s open science efforts; yet there has been little crossover between
                OHBM’s open science community and INCF. The purpose of this session is to present INCF’s open science
                efforts and discuss how the OHBM community can support the open science efforts of INCF, what resources/services
                INCF should offer in order to maximize the efforts of the community, and why an open science practitioner or
                advocate would choose or not choose to become a member and support such an organization such as INCF."
