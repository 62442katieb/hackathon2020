    A beautiful visualization is not just a good-looking piece of graph, chart, or colored brain.
    It is an informative and efficient way to represent our data and results, which follows the scientific
    principles (e.g. honesty truth, consistency etc.). A compelling visualization is essential to organize
    the data, display the results, communicate the information, as well as change the way we perceive the world.
    The Brain Art special interest group  will walk you through the basics, share the skills of brain visualization,
    and make the brain visualization novel, creative, aesthetic and fun to the community.

    Datalad is a versatile data management and data publication multitool. In this
    session, you can learn the basic concepts and commands for version control and reproducible data
    analysis. You’ll get to see, create, and install DataLad datasets of many shapes and sizes, master
    local version workflows and provenance-captured analysis-execution, and you will get ideas for your
    next data analysis project. Don’t forget to bring your computer and code along!

  long_description: "The Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform is a decentralized web platform for the open sharing of data and
   pipelines. We will present the main features of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform, including: (1) finding and
   downloading a dataset, (2) finding and running a pipeline, (3) uploading a dataset, and (4) uploading a tool.
   The demo will be recorded and could also serve as a tutorial. Only a web browser will be required to follow this tutorial,
  although advanced features would require Docker and DataLad."
