  the data, display the results, communicate the information, as well as change the way we perceive the world.

  and make the brain visualization novel, creative, aesthetic and fun to the community."

   downloading a dataset, (2) finding and running a pipeline, (3) uploading a dataset, and (4) uploading a tool.
   The demo will be recorded and could also serve as a tutorial. Only a web browser will be required to follow this tutorial,
  although advanced features would require Docker and DataLad."
