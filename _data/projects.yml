  title: "Learn and Enhance BrainIAK Tutorials: From Basics to Advanced fMRI Analyses"
  image: brainiak.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>This project will help participants learn fMRI analyses and enhance BrainIAK Tutorials (Kumar et al., 2020).
  Participants can practice a tutorial covering any topic of interest, from basics to advanced techniques.
  They can also contribute to the tutorials, by making edits, fixing bugs, or enhancing them by applying the techniques
  to their own datasets. We have a list an issue list for the tutorials that participants can pick an issue and work on.
  Some of the advanced techniques included are: Inter-Subject Correlations (ISC) (Hasson et al., 2004; Simony et al., 2016),
  Shared Response Modeling (SRM) (Chen et al., 2015), and Event Segmentation methods (Baldassano et al., 2017)

  title: "BIDS to NiftyTorch: data preparation for deep learning"
  image: NiftyTorch.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>We aim to build an automated pipeline to make a copy of BIDS formatted project for the purpose of deep learning
  and automatically evaluate the dataset. This includes, creating a randomly selected sets of training, validation and test
  dataset for deep learning, searching for missing data, evaluating consistency across image input using image size and modality,
  and maybe adding a module for quality assessment and preprocessing of the input data.

  title: "Tracktools"
  image: tracktools.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>In the latest years, I have developed/collected some tools for brain tractography, from inclusion in html,
  to 3Dprinter conversion to other manipulations. Codes is mostly in matlab and we should move in Python, moreover the converter
  from Trackvis to STL for 3Dprinting or Augmented Reality is not good. I am open minded to other ideas for tractography.

  title: "VB Index BIDS support / Pretty GUI"
  image: vb_index.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>I have been collaborating / leading a project that produced some software to 1) create 'cortical gradients'
  and a simple edge detection technique called the VB Index (see <a href=http://psyarxiv.com/7vzbk/>preprint</a>).
  We have a python and matlab tool but are focussing on the <a href=https://github.com/VBIndex/py_vb_toolbox>python version</a>.
  The brainhack project will be simple, allow the toolbox to accept BIDS data and / or create a simple (but pretty) GUI.

  title: "Tools for Combatting Citation Bias"
  image: Tools_citation_bias.PNG
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>Recent work in neuroscience and other fields has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women
  and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field. For this project, we seek to further the
  development of two tools to help researchers combat these trends in their own citation practices. The first tool is an interactive jupyter
  notebook that provides probabilistic gender break down of first and last authors from a bibliography in a bibtex file. The second is a Google
  Chrome extension that displays the probabilistic gender of first and last authors of papers on the common search engines Google Scholar and PubMed.

  title: "Wacky brain explosions Vol II."
  image: wackybrain.gif
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>Are you asking to yourself 'how can the year 2020 get more interesting?. The answer is simple: by using a particle simulator to explode
  some brains at the comfort of your home, in a completely safe virtual environment. <br>After concluding my <a href=https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues/7>previous hackaton project</a>
  with 'more research is needed', here I am planning to continue exploding more brains in many of ways. All in the name of neuro-science, of course!

  title: "shimming toolbox: Ecosystem for real-time shimming with MRI"
  image: whatever.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>A prerequisite to correcting/shimming the MR 'B0' field is of course to
  measure it (commonly done using a dual-echo gradient-echo sequence). A recent paper
  by <a href=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/aae570>Fatnassi and Zaidi</a>
  suggests that multi-echo (n>2) sequences may yield better accuracy and higher SNR.
  This brainhack project aims to implement multi-echo field mapping algorithms and assess their efficiency.

  title: "Hopfield Network Library"
  image: whatever.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use library for undirected
  neural networks, including Hopfield networks, Boltzmann machines, and Deep Belief
  networks. We also want to run empirical studies on the behavior of Hopfield networks,
  including memory capacity and time until convergence.

  title: "Vector Embeddings of Brain Dynamics"
  image: whatever.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>Whereas we can build time-varying functional connectivity (TVFC) graphs
  easily and efficiently using instantaneous wavelet coherence. And whereas we can
  compare TVFC graphs using a host of graph-graph metrics---from simple edge-wise
  overlap, to more robust methods from topological data analysis. The capacity to
  understand how TVFC states compare among volunteers is limited by the transductive
  nature of state-of-the-art manifold embedding algorithms such as tSNE and UMAP.
  Transductive methods tend to overweight the temporal adjacencies of graph-graph
  distances measured within single volunteers, and thereby ignore the large-scale
  graph-graph similarities measured across volunteers. To address this issue, this
  project aims to build vector embeddings of several TVFC graph-graph distances using
  a Siamese neural network.

  title: "Mapping the parameter space in EEG/MEG analyses"
  image: mapMEEG_Logo.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>The parameter space of M/EEG analysis pipelines is like a jungle.
  We will map it! We will first identify and classify available pipelines (based on available pre-registrations)
  and identify common challenges researchers face, then come up with a semantic framework to create and compare different pipelines,
  map software options onto the different analysis steps, and finally start designing an adaptive app for M/EEG pre-registration!

#   details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>C-MARINeR is a focused sub-project MARINeR: Multivariate Analysis and Resampling Inference
#     for Neuroimaging in R. The C stands generally for connectivity, but specifically and statistically:
#     covariance or correlation. The C-MARINeR project aims to develop and distribute an R package and
#     ShinyApp. Together, R + Shiny allows for ease of use and, hopefully, simpler exploration of such
#     complex data, and quicker adoption of the techniques. <br> More info here:

#     on something else, this is of course possible. We have also prepare some data to use the methods above,
#     but if you have your own data, please bring it with you and try to hack it with the methods presented."
