  group: "General questions"
  questions:
    - {question: "What is a hackathon?", answer: "The term hackathon is a portmanteau of 'hacking' and 'marathon'; traditionally, it is an event where people gather to collaboratively work on projects over the course of multiple days."}

    - {question: "Who can participate in a hackathon?", answer: "Anyone.<br>
    Hackathons have traditionally been more attended by those with programming experience; however, do not fear if you have little to no programming experience. There is more than one way to contibute and many of those do not involve coding: e.g a project getting very early feedback from its potentila target user can save a lot of time in the long run.<br>
    We are very committed to creating an atmosphere where newcomers who have never attended a hackathon before feel welcome. We want to make sure that you not only have the opportunity to learn new open-science skills in the traintrack that will help your future work but that you also get the chance to directly practice some of those skills by joining and collaborating on a hacktrack project."}

    - {question: "Why should I participate in a hackathon?", answer: "Hackathons are a great way to learn new skills that will be useful in your every day work as a researcher. It is also a very good way to meet, collaborate and exchange best practices with members of the community."}

  group: "OHBM brainhack"
  questions:
    - {question: "What is the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "OHBM Brainhacks are hackathons for students, engineers, medical doctors and researchers who work with MRI, PET, EEG, and MEG to come together to learn and collaborate. The OHBM Brainhacks have 2 components: a traintrack which is a series of workshops, tutorials and demos where you can learn new skills and a hacktrack where you can propose a project you need help with, or help others with their project."}

    - {question: "When is the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "The OHBM brainhack will be happening from the 16th to the 18th of June."}

    - {question: "Do I need to register for the OHBM conference to attend the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "No.<br>
    The main conference and the brainhack are separate events and you can choose to register only to the brainhack.<br>
    You do not need to be an OHBM member to register and the price of registration will be the same whether you are an OHBM member or not."}

    - {question: "When is the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "Online.<br>
    This year the OHBM Brainhack will be a fully virtual event."}

    - {question: "How will the first ever virtual OHBM brainhack be different?", answer: "The open-science special interest group of OHBM wants to rise to the challenge we are all facing and create a decentralized online event to foster global engagement and collaboration across time zones and geographical boundaries. For 3 days, no matter where you are on the planet, there will be traintrack sessions happening where you can learn new things and hacktrack projects that you can join."}

    - {question: "Why will there be several hubs?", answer: "While anyone around the world can join an online event, we wanted to make it easier for people to join during typical working hours. "}

    - {question: "Who is running the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "The OHBM Brainhack is organized and run by the open-science special interest group (the OS SIG) of OHBM with support from many volunteers in the OHBM community. We are in particular very grateful for the help of the Brainhack Global team that has been involved in organizing the Brainhack global events in the previous years.<br>
    All of this is also made possible by a team of volunteers (graduate students, post-docs, researchers, and professors) that are involved in research in neurosciences in various institutions all around the world."}

    - {question: "How can we contact the OHBM brainhack team?", answer: "If you want to get in touch, you can:
    <ul>
    <li> <a href='https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-hackathon' target='_blank'> Join the OHBM hackathon channel on our mattermost discussion forum </a> </li>
    <li> Follow us on <a href='https://twitter.com/OhbmOpen'  target='_blank'>twitter </a> </li>
    </ul>"}

    - {question: "What are 'brainhack mentors'?", answer: "A brainhack is very different from a regular conference and can be an intimidating experience when you have never attended one before. We want to make it easier for new-comers to join by pairing them with a “mentor” with whom they can meet before the brainhack starts and during the brainhack."}
-
  group: "If you are attending the OHBM brainhack"
  questions:
    - {question: "May I submit a project? ", answer: "Yes.<br>
    Anyone registered to the hackathon can submit a project to the project pool.
    It might be either a project you are already working on and would like help with or a completely new project you would like to start.<br>
    However to keep things to a manageable size we have decided to limit the number of projects to 25 projects per hub."}

    - {question: "Do I have to submit a project?", answer: "No.<br>
    You can if you want, but you can register and attend the Brainhack to only follow the traintrack and / or help an existing project."}

    - {question: "Does my project have to involve computer programming?", answer: "No.<br>
    It is true that a lot of Brainhack projects involve some coding but this is not always the case.<br>
    Examples of non-coding Brainhack projects we had in the past include: <a href='https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/issues/47' target='_blank'>developing guidelines for gathering consent from participants compliant with GDPR</a> or protocols and where all the work will be done in a google doc.<br>
    In our opinion, any project facilitating collaboration, openness, and reproducibility within the open-neuroscience community is welcome."}

    - {question: "How do I submit a project? ", answer: "First please register to the Brainhack. Instructions on how to submit a project will be sent to all participants. Then you will have to provide certain pieces of information about your project. They are described <a href='https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hackathon-project-template.md' target='_blank'>here</a> and a project advisor will help you get everything set up."}

    - {question: "What is the deadline for project submission?", answer: "We will close project submission one week before the brainhack starts (on the 8th of June), but we recommend you send a draft submission 2 weeks before so that our project advisors have time to guide you through the project set up."}

    - {question: "How do I join a project at a hackathon? ", answer: "In the weeks leading up to the hackathon, project leaders will submit a description of their project. The projects will be listed on a GitHub repository and on the website. So you can start having a look at what projects are lined up and think about which one you want to join. Then at the hackathon each project leader has to pitch his project at the beginning of the event. Then there will be some time for you to chat with the project leaders before you 'decide' which projects to join. But it is a very flexible thing: if you are interested in different projects and want to do a bit of both: it is OK."}

    - {question: "Can I help the OHBM brainhack team in any way?", answer: "Yes.<br>
    We have listed the different roles that we will need help with on the ‘hub structure’ section of our logistics page."}

    - {question: "What should I do if I encounter an action that violates the Code of Conduct?", answer: "The OHBM brainhack follows the <a href='https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/coc/' target='_blank'>OHBM Code of Conduct.</a> If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. <br>

    - {question: "What is the background picture on the OHBM brainhack website landing page?", answer: "This is Montreal where the OHBM brainhack should have happened. We decided to keep the picture:
    <ul>
    <li>Because it is pretty.</li>
    <li>Because we got used to seeing this picture and it makes us feel at home.</li>
    <li>Because Montreal is a great city and you should totally visit if / when you get the chance.</li>"}
