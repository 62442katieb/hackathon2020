  questions:
    - {question: "What is a hackathon?", answer: "The term hackathon is a portmanteau of 'hacking' and 'marathon';
    traditionally, it is an event where people gather to collaboratively work on projects over the
    course of multiple days."}

    - {question: "Who can participate in a hackathon?", answer: "Everyone!<br>
    While hackathons have traditionally been more attended by those with 
    programming experience, we are very committed to create an event that will 
    be more welcoming for all. <br/>

    In particular, please consider joining if you have little to no programming 
    experience: there are many ways to contribute and we 
    would be very pleased to benefit from *your* skills! In fact, our hope is 
    that many projects will not involve coding.<br/>

    We are also very committed to creating an atmosphere where newcomers who 
    have never attended a hackathon before feel welcome. We will provide 
    opportunities to learn new open science skills in the <b>Traintrack</b> that 
    could help with your future work and also the possibility to directly 
    practice some of those skills by joining and collaborating on a <b>Hacktrack</b>
    project."}

    - {question: "Why should I participate in a hackathon?", answer: "Hackathons are a great way to
    learn new skills that will be useful in your every day work as a researcher. Beyond that,
    hackathons are also an opportunity to meet, collaborate and exchange best practices with members
    of the community."}

  group: "OHBM brainhack"
  questions:
    - {question: "What is the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "The OHBM Brainhack is the hackathon
    facilitated by the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group (OS-SIG). This event typically
    gathers students, engineers, medical doctors and researchers in brain research to learn and
    collaborate. The event usually takes place the 3 days preceding the annual OHBM meeting.<br>
    An OHBM Brainhack has 2 components: a <b>TrainTrack</b> which is a series of workshops, tutorials and
    demos where you can learn new skills and a <b>HackTrack</b> where you can propose a project you need
    help with, or help others with their project.<br>
    Some of you might have heard about “hackathons” in which teams compete to achieve a predefined
    goal; sometimes by working extreme hours for a couple of days. The Brainhack hackathons instead
    strive for collaboration, co-learning and inclusivity. We design those events so that everyone
    can join and 24 hour availability is not a requirement."}

    - {question: "When is the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "The OHBM brainhack will be happening from
    the 16th to the 18th of June, 2020."}

    - {question: "Do I need to register for the OHBM conference to attend the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "No.<br>
    The main OHBM conference and the brainhack are separate events and you can choose to
    <a href='http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/HackathonReg/' target='_blank'>register</a>
    for Brainhack only.<br>
    You do not need to be an OHBM member to register and the price of registration will be the same whether
    you are an OHBM member or not."}

    - {question: "Where is the OHBM brainhack happening?", answer: "Online.<br>
    This year the OHBM Brainhack will be a fully virtual event."}

    - {question: "How will the first ever virtual OHBM brainhack be different?",
    answer: "The open-science special interest group of OHBM wants to rise to the challenge we
    are all facing and create a decentralized online event to foster global engagement and
    collaboration across time zones and geographical boundaries. For 3 days, no matter where
    you are on the planet, there will be TrainTrack sessions happening where you can learn new
    things and HackTrack projects that you can join."}

    - {question: "Why will there be several hubs?", answer: "While anyone around the world can join
    an online event, it is very important for us that everyone can attend during typical working
    hours. The hubs are designed so that they all share the same schedule but run at a different time."}

    - {question: "Who is running the OHBM brainhack?", answer: "The OHBM Brainhack is organized and
    run by the open-science special interest group (the OS SIG) of OHBM with support from many volunteers
    in the OHBM community. We are in particular very grateful for the help of the Brainhack Global team
    that has been involved in organizing the Brainhack global events in the previous years."}

    - {question: "How can we contact the OHBM brainhack team?", answer: "If you want to get in touch, you can:
    <ul>
    <li> <a href='https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/hbm-hackathon' target='_blank'>
    Join the OHBM hackathon channel on our mattermost discussion forum </a> </li>
    <li> Follow us on <a href='https://twitter.com/OhbmOpen'  target='_blank'>twitter </a> </li>
    <li> If you have a specific question about the event, you can reach out to us
    <a href='mailto:ossig2019@inria.fr'>here</a> </li>.
    </ul>"}

    - {question: "What are 'brainhack mentors'?", answer: "A brainhack is very different from a
    regular conference.
    We want to make it easier for new-comers to join by pairing them with a “mentor” with whom they
    can meet during the Brainhack to discuss any questions."}
-
  group: "If you are attending the OHBM brainhack"
  questions:
    - {question: "May I submit a project? ", answer: "Yes.<br>
    Anyone registered to Brainhack can submit a project to the project pool.
    It might be either a project you are already working on and would like help with or a completely
    new project you would like to start.<br>
    However to keep things to a manageable size we have decided to limit the number of projects to
    25 projects per hub."}

    - {question: "Do I have to submit a project?", answer: "No.<br>
    You can if you want, but you can
    <a href='http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/HackathonReg/' target='_blank'>register</a>
    and attend the Brainhack to follow the TrainTrack and / or participate to an existing project."}

    - {question: "Does my project have to involve computer programming?", answer: "No.<br>
    It is true that a lot of Brainhack projects involve some coding but this is not always the case.<br>
    Examples of non-coding Brainhack projects we had in the past include:
      <a href='https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/issues/47' target='_blank'>developing guidelines
      for gathering consent from participants compliant with GDPR</a> or protocols and where all the
    work is carried out in a shared document.<br>
    Projects facilitating collaboration, openness, and reproducibility within the open-neuroscience community is welcome. "}

    - {question: "How do I submit a project? ", answer: "First please
    <a href='http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/HackathonReg/' target='_blank'>register</a>
    to the Brainhack.<br>
    You can then submit a project
    <a href='https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/issues/new/choose' target='_blank'>here</a>.
    We will ask you to provide some information about your project in order to advertise it and
    help onboarding new members. If you have any question on the way of submitting your project,
    a dedicated advisor will be here to guide you.<br>
    Depending on the topic of your submitted project, our project advisor might recommend that you
    check out another submitted project and possibly merge. In order to keep things to a manageable
    size, we are hoping to limit the number of projects to 25 projects per hub."}

    - {question: "What is the deadline for project submission?", answer: "We will close project
    submission one week before the brainhack starts (on the 8th of June), but we recommend you send
    a draft submission 2 weeks before so that our project advisors have time to guide you through
    the project set up."}

    - {question: "How do I join a project? ", answer: "In the weeks leading up to the
    brainhack, project leaders will submit a description of their project. The projects will be
    listed on <a href='https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Hackathon+project%22'
    target='_blank'>on the GitHub repository</a> and <a href='https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/hackathon/'
    target='_blank'>on the website</a>. So you can start having a look at what projects
    are lined up and think about which one you want to join. Then at the brainhack each project leader
    has to pitch his project at the beginning of the event. Then there will be some time for you to chat
    with the project leaders before you 'decide' which projects to join. But it is a very flexible thing:
    if you are interested in different projects and want to do a bit of both: it is OK."}

    - {question: "Can I help the OHBM brainhack team in any way?", answer: "Yes.<br>
    We have listed the different roles that we will need help with on the ‘hub structure’ section of
    our logistics page."}

    - {question: "What should I do if I encounter an action that violates the Code of Conduct?",
    answer: "The OHBM brainhack follows the <a href='https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/coc/'
    target='_blank'>OHBM Code of Conduct.</a> If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or
    unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. <br>

    - {question: "What is the background picture on the OHBM brainhack website landing page?",
    answer: "This is Montreal where the OHBM brainhack should have happened. We decided to keep the picture:
    <ul>
    <li>Because it is pretty.</li>
    <li>Because we got used to seeing this picture and it makes us feel at home.</li>
    <li>Because Montreal is a great city and you should totally visit if / when you get the chance.</li>"}
